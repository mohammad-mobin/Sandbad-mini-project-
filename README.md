# Sandbad-mini-project-
This is my first project. This project is about introducing famous hotels in Iran and its content is written in English and is completely real. This mini-project took about a week to complete. This project uses languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, and JS. And I made it responsive using flexbox and media queries. I hope you like this mini-project.
