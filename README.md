# Sandbad-mini-project-

This is my first project.👨‍💻
This project is about introducing famous hotels in Iran and its
content is written in English and is completely real.
This mini-project took about a week to complete.
This project uses languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, and JS.
And I made it responsive using flexbox and media queries.
The Poppins family font was used in this project.
I hope you like this mini-project.😉🥰
